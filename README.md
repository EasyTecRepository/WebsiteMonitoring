# StatuspageAutomation
Automation script of current website statuses using statuspage.io API

Welcome to this repository!
This repository contains a script with which you can query the current status of your websites.
These are loaded directly into the statuspage.io overview via API, so you can see from anywhere if one of your services has errors or even crashed completely.

If you need a detailed tutorial on setting it up, feel free to [check out this video on YouTube](https://youtube.com/EasyTec100)!
